# Net 60 Receivables and Ageing Analysis

## Business question
How much remains unpaid, how old is it, and which customers need review first?

Portfolio demonstration in Sairaj Jadhav’s analytics portfolio. All data is synthetic and is generated
deterministically; this is not TCA data or a professional implementation.

## Data
120 customers, 1,800 invoices and multiple allocated payment records, including future payment dates.

### Data dictionary
customers: customer_id, segment. invoices: invoice_id, customer_id, invoice_date, due_date, invoice_paise. payments: payment_id, invoice_id, payment_date, paid_paise.

All amounts with `_paise` suffix are integer hundredths of INR to avoid storing source currency
as floating-point numbers. Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. The fixed reporting cutoff is 21 October 2026.
Integer IDs are unique primary keys; relationship fields are enforced as foreign keys.

## Method and KPI definitions
Due date = invoice date + 60 calendar days. Outstanding = invoice value less allocated payments dated on or before the cutoff. Days past due = cutoff minus due date. Fully paid invoices are separated; due-today balances are not overdue.

Read [schema.sql](schema.sql) for constraints and [analysis.sql](analysis.sql) for queries.
The SQL is written for SQLite; date functions require adaptation for PostgreSQL or SQL Server.
Inputs are generated and cleaned in [analysis.py](analysis.py), then loaded into the schema.
Where deliberate source defects are introduced, they are quarantined rather than silently repaired.

## Results
Invoice ageing, ranked customer exposure, ageing summary and ageing chart.

Read the [computed findings](findings.md) and [validation record](validation.json).
These files are regenerated from the scripts, not manually invented.

## Reproduce
Install Python 3.10+ and run from this repository directory:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python analysis.py
python tests.py
```

The script saves CSV inputs, a local SQLite database, query output CSVs, a chart and findings.
It independently computes comparable Pandas metrics and asserts agreement with SQL, checks
reconciliations and tests relevant edge cases. No network access or credentials are needed.

## Limitations and next steps
No credit score, default probability or lending decision. No collections recoveries are claimed.

Before operational use: agree definitions, reconcile source-system totals, investigate rejected
records, collect missing business context, validate assumptions with users and add incremental loads.
This is a small analytical example, not a production application or a claimed business improvement.

The SQLite database is generated locally and excluded from version control. `tests.py` uses small, hand-checkable fixtures against the actual SQL.
